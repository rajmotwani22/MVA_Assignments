summary(fit)
#Summary has three sections. Section1: How well does the model fit the data. Section2: Is the hypothesis supported?. Section3: How well does data fit the model .

#The model exhibits a moderate level of fit to the data, as indicated by the Multiple R-squared (0.5027) and Adjusted R-squared (0.4924) values. These statistics suggest that approximately 50.27% of the variance in rank is explained by the independent variables considered, adjusting for the complexity of the model. However, when assessing the significance of individual predictors, only the intercept and finalWorth coefficients appear highly significant, while the coefficients for age, birthMonth, and birthDay do not reach statistical significance. Consequently, the evidence supporting the hypothesis varies across predictors. The residual standard error (RSE) of approximately 40.83 indicates the average deviation between observed and predicted ranks, while the F-statistic's significant p-value (< 2.2e-16) suggests that the model as a whole provides a better fit to the data compared to an intercept-only model.

#Interpretation from Durbin Watson Test:
#The D-W statistic (2.04) falls within the inconclusive zone (typically between 1.5 and 2.5). This makes it difficult to definitively reject or accept the null hypothesis.
#The p-value (0.374) is greater than significance level 0.05. This suggests that we fail to reject the null hypothesis at this significance level.


#Residual Analysis: The QQ plot shows a slight curvature, particularly in the tails. The tails of the data points fall slightly outside the diagonal reference line, suggesting that the residuals might have heavier tails than a normal distribution. This indicates potential non-normality.
