#The Hotelling's test was employed to compare the average values of rank, age, and finalWorth between two groups categorized by the selfMade variable. With a resulting test statistic of 2.2085 and degrees of freedom of 3 for the numerator and 193 for the denominator, the calculated p-value of 0.5361 indicates a lack of statistical significance. Consequently, there is insufficient evidence to support the assertion that there are disparities in the mean characteristics (rank, age, finalWorth) between self-made billionaires and those who are not self-made in the dataset.

#The F-test for variance compared the variability in the rank variable between self-made and non-self-made billionaires. With an F-statistic of 0.85711 and a p-value of 0.4582, the results indicate no significant difference in variance between the two groups. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the variability in rank is similar regardless of self-made status among billionaires in the dataset.

# Hotelling Test

# Leverne test is used to verify Homoscedasticity. It tests if the variance of two samples are # #equal. Levene's test is an inferential statistic used to assess the equality of variances for a #variable calculated for two or more groups.[1] Some common statistical procedures assume that #variances of the populations from which different samples are drawn are equal. Levene's test #assesses this assumption.

#The Levene's test for homogeneity of variance was performed to assess whether the variance of rank, age, and finalWorth differs significantly between self-made and non-self-made billionaires. For rank and age variables, the test did not reveal any significant difference in variance between the two groups, with p-values of 0.2836 and 0.6926, respectively. However, for the finalWorth variable, the test similarly found no significant difference in variance between the groups, with a p-value of 0.6926. These results suggest that there is no strong evidence to reject the assumption of equal variances between self-made and non-self-made billionaires for the variables examined.

The test resulted in a Chi-Square statistic of 6.3223 with 6 degrees of freedom and a corresponding p-value of 0.3881. 
#Since the p-value is greater than the significance level of 0.05, there is insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the covariance matrices do not significantly differ between the two groups.

#A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted to examine whether there are significant differences in the combined set of numeric variables (rank, age, finalWorth) between self-made and non-self-made billionaires. The MANOVA test yielded a Pillai's trace statistic of 0.011199, an approximate F-value of 0.72862 with 3 numerator degrees of freedom and 193 denominator degrees of freedom, and a corresponding p-value of 0.5361.
# These results indicate that there is no significant difference in the combined set of numeric variables between self-made and non-self-made billionaires, as the p-value is greater than the conventional significance level of 0.05.
